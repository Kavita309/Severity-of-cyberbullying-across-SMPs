"`:if you ever claimed in a judaic studies program that ultra-orthodox jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room.   ::i am beginning to see the problem you have. you see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. never once did i say that ultra-orthodox jews have no rabbis or synagogues. i did say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-orthodox judaism is minimal when compared with, say, conservative judaism. they are not clergy, in the traditional western sense of the word. that is a fact. as for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-orthodox law) is essential. you can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. you can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. it may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. i want to know who laughs then.   :if you ever claimed in a recognized judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-orthodox rabbis accept and follow modern orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads.   ::also a silly point. if you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-orthodox and modern orthodox judaism in a recognized judaic studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. a) that statement is false, because responsa in orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. b) what is a modern orthodox responsa versus an ultra-orthodox responsa? c) in cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. if you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. for example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). most modern-orthodox jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by rabbi moshe feinstein who determined that american government supervision is sufficient. most ultra-orthodox jews do insist on it. they do not reject the responsa. in fact, moshe feinstein (reb moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the american ultra-orthodox community in the past fifty years. they will say that the ruling is right but they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). it is not a rejection. it is simply being stricter. ovadya yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts. would any of his daughters or daughters-in-law be caught dead in pants? no way. they are machmir.   :you just can't make this stuff up, danny.   ::i dunno. i seem to be giving answers to everything you say, and my answers are based on sources. i am not making things up. i am simply stating things that (no matter how inconceivable it may be) you do not know.   :stop trying to re-make the ultra-orthodox in your own image. its not good history. frankly, i don't care what is on your resume. it doesn't justify writing such nonsense.  rk  : personal attacks. i will say that your intellectual arrogance coupled with your apparent ignorance do not put you in a very good light.   in my professional life, i have researched and written extensively on this field, developed relationships  both working and personal  with many of the people involved, and worked on several important documentary films on the topic. i think i have a sense of what npov is, and a statement that the ultra-orthodox ``hate`` the non-ultra-orthodox just doesn't make the mark.   : is beating the shit out of non-orthodox jews an act of love? is calling them ``worse than hitler`` an act of love? is accusing them of creating the holocaust an act of tolerance? danny, you can protest all you like, but you obviously so immersed in an ultra-orthodox worldview that you can't see the forest for the trees. this is violent hatespeech, and it frightens me to see an educuated person making apologetics for it. rk  :: then it must frighten you even more knowing that i was actually there (and on one occasion, actually hit). why? because i do not feel the same antagonism that you do? because i see some distasteful remarks in a certain context? you say in your diatribe that you want everyone to sit together and sing a shlomo carlebach niggun. just answer me this though? would reb shloime have davened in a shul without a mehitza?   oh, and haredi does not mean ``trembling,`` as you originally wrote at the top of the article. in fact, that was kind of funny. you were apparently confused with the film trembling before god, which ",none

(all the words shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). i sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism. i think it's probably sufficient simply to say when and by whom the term was coined. comments? `",none

"`i was sad to see that you're going to be away for the next week, because as you're coming back, i will be leaving for the summer after that.  i want you to know that despite our disagreements, i really appreciate what you're trying to do.  it's difficult for most people to write a truly npov article, which is why what wikipedia does is so great.  by having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth.    unfortunately, the holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work.  it is a subject which should be purely history.  the nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened.  we know, because of the monthly reports written by himmler.``  unfortunately, holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise.  they tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda.  this is just who they are.  they cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``the jewish problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.  at the same time, i can't exactly claim to be npov either.  it is fairly clear from what i have already written here that i hold holocaust deniers in no high esteem.  quite frankly, i find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people.  it is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the united states, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten.  it would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the jews.    it is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument.  i would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes.  holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-semitic.  my personal favourite group believes that jews are shape shifting lizards from mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity.  and yes, this group has a following.  the ``holocaust revisionist`` lines and the ``jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door.  the people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what hitler started.  i encourage you to write carefully about what they believe, but please don't be fooled by them.  i wish you the best of luck.   `",none

"`  i disagree with the hard-and-fast division into ``english`` and ``non-english`` in the billion and trillion (which is too definite imo) articles, (but agree the accepted wikipedia value should be the us one). here is why.  my collins english-german dictionary, third edition, purchased in england 1997, has this entry:  trillion n (brit) trillion f; (us) billion f.  now the trillion referred to is the german for 1 followed by 18 zeroes, and billion is the german word for 1 followed by 12 zeroes. my few german acquaintances tell me they know this difference between the british and american (us) usage of ``trillion``. similarly for billion. also i did once hear an english-speaking person use ``milliard``, i had to ask them what it was! they (a well educated but non-british person) thought it was a common english word.  my cassell's english-italian dictionary, admittedly an old 1985 edition, makes the same distinction in this way:  billion bilione (english, 1,000,000,000,000; amer. 1,000,000,000)  similar distinction for trillion. neither divides the usage into ``english`` and ``non-english``, speaking or otherwise.  admittedly current usage in the united kingdom is either confusion or has adopted the american (us) usage. this has certainly been the case  in the financial industry. i was taught the 'old' british usage of both terms in a school run by americans in a british colony (helps to pass the british exams).  the www.unc.edu link in talk:trillion above explains this, so i feel the articles should reflect this admittedly ambiguous difference. i tend to clarify when speaking english to well-educated non-british europeans (who are aware of the problem with billion and trillion), as to exactly which i am using (``american`` or ``british``) to make it clear.  having said all that i'm not sure what's best: american and non-american; english and non-english; british and american (how the dictionaries usually give it); standard usage and non-standard? - |  11:06, 2004 jul 21 (utc)`",none

"  while you are correct that 'toughened glass' could be considered a misnomer (toughness has a specific meaning with regard to the strength of materials), tempering glass is not.  in fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical.  regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature.  on initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. however, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass.  prince rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena.  if a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole.  you can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break.  however if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop.  thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields.  chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used.  for example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass.  thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 mpa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 mpa.  chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers.

"  ardent nationalism basically sums up every nation i can think of on the face of the planet at present.  it makes sense that a nation would extol the virtues of itself, right?  the prc does not have a cult of personality, does not glorify male youth as fighters, does not glorify female youth as future incubators.  mysticism is missing from official chinese pronouncements too.  also missing is the stated goal of said society.  left totalitarian regimes like china see a future where a hierarchy of work-production, and distribution can be overcome once production is more automated with robotics and technology and economic scarcity can be overcome.  allowing private property is a means towards an end in the case of china (market socialism).  right totalitarian regimes see hierarchy as the natural and permanent order of things, and the existence of private property is not a mean to an end, but the end to be preserved within itself.  a broad definition of fascism which would more correctly have to be termed corporatism if we say that mysticism, gender roles, and ideological heritage/stated aims aren't necessary conditions, then that would also allow us to place countries like the u.s since the 1930's, social-democratic germany, and keynesian japan in that category. the main difference between fascism and capitalist-democratic or more benign corporatist states is the right for trade unions and combinations to engage in collective bargaining and even work stopages (strikes) against the immediate consent of the state or business.   unions have this right in china today, to a limited extent, as in the u.s to a limited extent.  on an economic basis, germany may be considered more corporatist or economically interventionist than the u.s, but politically the citizens have more rights to protest and engage in collective bargaining or form new unions. unless i can be swayed from this line of thought, and i am open to it, i will mercilessly edit out grouping the prc as fascist.

"  wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, but that's besides the point.  i agree: the element phosphorus is bound to be looked up more often than phosphorus meaning venus and so that article should take priority (in terms of where the user is taken when they search). however, wikipedia is not designed to be used purely by wikipedia editors or those clued up with its conventions (nor those willing to take the time to discover them), but by anybody who wants quick and helpful access to a topic. is such a person likely to expect to find a footnote at the bottom of the element article - i certainly don't think so. i would have thought such a person would give up at that point and look elsewhere. i don't think such a person would expect the topic they're searching for to be a footnote to something entirely different. however, if the 'dab' (is that an official term?) is at the top of this article, this certainly isn't a problem.  i think it's poor practice - even if it is a general practice - to place disambiguation notices (i don't see why their 'significance' is a factor; either they're so insignificant they don't merit an article, or they do and hence shouldn't be hidden away) at the bottom of articles, since this makes the task of the user so much harder, whereas surely an encyclopedia should strive to make access to information as easy as possible.  how relevant the links to the page are i'm unsure: i would have thought many people access information by entering search terms, rather than coming from a different page, and so will not have the clarification of the article's name you seem to imply.

  :good to know your profession. i like working in a multidisciplinary team. after beavering away at the change in categories i think i upset one of the people looking after the psychology category who went through redoing their categories. it would be nice if we could work together on this project to achieve a sort of mini psych textbook. i think that would also help those who currently take a rather oppositional approach to find that we don't have three heads and aren't out to harm them. i can already see some of this mollification occurring with some contributors. still my bias is to add to the clinical psychiatric area since this is my field. tonight i am working on psychiatric history which i hope to have ready for upload later tonight. is there an article on overvalued idea? if not there should be. just a suggestion.

"  == parentacide ==  parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.  parentacide dates back to greek mythology, where oedipus killed his father laius and married his mother jocasta. frued coined the term oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.  in 1989 lyle and erik menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.  jeremy bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. being adopted, bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",none

"`  :let me explain the problems in your paragraph, which for ease of reference i include below.  ::prime minister blair is known in britain as well as the united states for his personal closeness to us president bush. the two's coordination is uncanny, rarely ever voicing direct disagreements and presenting united stances on most issues; sometimes with blair going against the labour party as well as the majority of british citizens. in may, he backed the controversial israeli withdrawal plan for the gaza strip, a radical departure from traditional british politics toward the region, and a move that put the british government in the position of being the only major nation besides the us to support it. he acquiesced to american requests in october to send scotland's prestigious black watch battalion to baghdad. recently, the prime minister responded to a question on the environment with a stance very close to what the president bush's was. this ``special relationship`` between george w. bush and tony blair has drawn a mixed bag of reactions in the uk, but it continues to be strong. in november 2004, the prime minister travelled to washington in hopes of using the close friendship to influence the president's stances on a european summit, environment/climate control, and an israeli-palestinian peace plan.  :the first sentence is acceptable and is in the article. the second is where the problems start. ``the two's coordination is uncanny`` is the sort of statement one would make about two lovers, and will carry this meaning to readers. as for ``rarely ever voicing direct disagreements``, you will find this in most public utterances in diplomacy, regardless of any actual disagreements. for example read the press conference with blair and chirac earlier this month. the issue of dissent within the labour party over blair has already been covered in the article and needs no repeating here.  :the uk government's support for the gaza withdrawal plan is hardly ``a radical departure`` and, even if it was such a statement would be pov. see 'the chariot of israel' by harold wilson for the full story of british support for israel over the years to 1981. also, the israeli labour party has supported it, and that carries weight in its british sister party. then the use of the term 'acquiesced' which is only used in a subservient relationship and is therefore pejorative, as is the insertion of 'prestigious' before the regiment: this reads as if it magnifies any offence because the regiment involved was more distinguished than others.   :the remark about the environment lacks any detail but is irrelevant: the uk government policy hasn't changed and is quite distinct from the us, so anything which blair might have said at a press conference is neither here nor there. finally we come to a report of blair's visit to the us which states that it was about the environment (it wasn't - see press conference) and is imprecise. this issue, and the rest of this edit, is better covered in the article as it was, and i have therefore reverted it.  `",none

"`  ==video poker==  video poker machine payout tables only represent a theoretical payout percentage. the vast majority of gamers cannot achieve that payout percentage because they do not play correctly.  it is essential to draw correctly depending on the content of each dealt hand, and there are strategy tables devised by computer which determine how to do so, depending on the payout table. (hence you need different strategy tables for different payout tables!)  my ambition is to add such strategy tables to the video poker article, but i can't just copy-and-paste such strategies from an existing book due to copyright. to get around that problem, i have an off-the-shelf analytical program that allows the creation of strategy tables based on a weighting of difficulty vs. accuracy. these tables are slightly different than the published ones, but still accomplish the desired positive payoff.  if you're interested in getting a good feel for this, there is a training program called ``winpoker`` available from zamzow software, (in the u.s.), that allows you to practice, as well as automatically run through a great number of hands using a given payout table and strategy.  cheers,   `",none

"`  § i got in touch with the owner of the website mentioned above, and he has offered to e-mail me a scanned copy of the map in the book illustration, which shows an intermediate band where the white band occurs near the northern tip of africa.  i had a closer look at the maps i found in the library, and none of them improves on what was in that website. the one major difference that a revised map probably ought to take account of is the division of australia into two regions. i'll make overlays to check, but it looks like the only other changes involve reducing 8 zones to 5. if you check out the cavelli-sforza map (which i now think is a photo reproduction of the original map) you can easily understand why authors would decide to simplify the number of zones  cavelli-sforza's map is o.k. for the lighter half of the shades of skin color, but the darker shades are practically indistinguishable.  sometimes, if you know where to look, you will see what looks like a little halftoning rather than straight black ink. but for practical purposes the map is pretty useless outside of the values that are shown in the americas.   § in a way it was a good thing that the original map was so washed out. if i hadn't really looked carefully at it i'm pretty sure i'd have missed the white band. the uncorrected map has propagated so many places on the www that it's hard to believe the original maker of the digitized image has any objection to others using it.    ==cleanup== we need to clean up the article. the sections should only treat what it says they do in the section title. for example, there shouldn't be a paragraph `` :``in everyday speech, race is often used to describe populations that are better defined as ethnic groups...`` at the end of ``history of the term``. nor should the ``anthropology and genetics`` section, being placed after the history section, i.e. we are through with the historical aspect now, begin with  :``in the 19th century many natural scientists made three claims about race: ...`` (i.e. this bit still belongs in the 'history' section). also the case studies (usa, brazil) should either be exported to special articles, or at least be placed after the more general phylogenetic subsection. somebody should read the entire article and weed out repetitions, too.    == von luschan scale ==  § the von luschan scale was a manufactured set of standard tiles that were colored so that a researcher could in relatively rapid order sort through his/her tiles and find the one that came closest to matching a given subject's skin color. essentially the same method is still used today, at least in this increasingly anti-scientific nation, by dentists who want to match ceramic material used for making fillings with the color of their patient's tooth. they have a little cabinet full of ceramic ``teeth`` on little spindles. each specimen has a different combination of hue and brightness from the others. although one could easily create an electronic device to measure these factors to tighter tolerances, the low-tech device seems to meet professional standards. similarly, given the fact that a subject's skin color could vary considerably due to contingent factors such as season and weather patterns, the von luchan tiles probably provide all the accuracy that is useful. `",none

"  i wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims i am ennis are false. if the 'number is ennis' dichotomy was removed the talk pages would be near empty! i wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.  but, that's rhetorical - as i said, there must be certain camaraderie among wiki people and i doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.  now you have asked me a sensible question, so i'll answer.  for some time i watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the uk/claiming they were in the uk were summarily dismissed. worse, posters were automatically accused of being ennis.  one reason given was that the posts were anonymous.  so i thought, as i know more about ennis than others from the uk posting here (imo) i'd try to add to these pages. however, even with an identity, i got exactly the same treatment. in fact cardinal chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-sollog website and is well known in google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).  so it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'you're a sock puppet! you’re ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.  i therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' i was not ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others.   i tried to prove i was not in america (i thought these days all ips were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) i quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.  this was dismissed.  someone else even went to a pub in lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.  that too was dismissed.  so it became obvious that no proof i (or anyone else) was not ennis would ever be accepted.  therefore the only other option if i felt i had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up btw)  in vain did i quote wiki official policy. plainly it is not obeyed by editors/administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.  so what is left? i cannot invoke wiki policy. i cannot 'prove' i am here, in england sitting quietly in front of a pc.  two choices.  stop posting completely  try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. the only challenge worth it would be one where i did not personally gain (of course i would win because i am not ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. ashley) acted as 'witness'.  hence the challenge.  i fear that will be deleted; i'll be castigated a usual and that's that. it really is just hopeless.  i have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted i’ll know there simply is no hope and i'll delete all my posts if i can find them.  you see, unless people accept i am not ennis everything i or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. i'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.  i have other interests - i posted on the yoga page but it's quiet and i am interested in politics etc etc.  so we'll see what happens. like i said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what i assume are adults.  so there you are. i have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. it will answer the question - at least for these sollog pages - as to whether wiki should be taken seriously or not.  finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article i am writing (i am a freelance writer and no, i’m not going to prove it) before i send it off to newspapers. if it is accepted though i shall return just the once, to link to the article!

"`  - continued:  i checked the history of recent edits.  i find it hypocritical that the words ``sell`` and ``price`` have been changed to ``offer`` and ``donation``. what the * is that all about? is it because thc ministry has been registered as a religion that the action of trading funds for a product has ``miraculously`` transformed from simple business to ``donations`` and ``offerings``? that is marketing speech. that is in no way different from any businessman's simple strategy.  since thc ministry supposedly ``offers`` a product in exchange of a ``donation``, shouldn't that imply that they would also give away freely the product in some cases? shouldn't that imply that there would be no set price, as a donation is usually considered an act of variable value? because otherwise that is just plain business. nothing saintly about it.  i would like to know - just to clear things out - where these ``donations`` go to and who they benefit. are the funds used to address the issues of unethical drug wars? are the funds used to fight what is wrong in society? or are they merely collected to the personal accounts of the ``priesthood`` of thc ministry? who could answer me?  if one would allow oneself a cynical outlook, he'd certainly see this as a pretty package covering a simple money-making scheme.  juuso`",none
"`   ==changes, subtle errors == oleg, i am concerned about the edits that you are making.  my first impression is that it is much harder to understand than it used to be.  it used to be precise as to what it meant; much of that precision has been removed. the result is the sublte introduction of errors...   in part by removing that precision.  for example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly different: if p(tau) is a polynomial, then  n^(deg p(tau)) = deg p(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of.  and you cut out the paragraphs that made this distinction: tau a is not equal to a tau, but tau a is equal to a^p tau ...  the ring is never commutative when the field is not f_p ...   the field is called f_p not z/pz dammit. we already talked about this before. nobody but you calls it that.  stating that ap(x) is also additive is important, i don't see why you cut that out.   k{tau} is not k[x] e.g the next theorem to mention is that for any p(x) in k[x] there exists a g(tau) in k{tau} such that f(x) divides g(x).  these g(tau)'s are a left ideal in k{tau}  using language like ``its quite easy to prove`` and ``it follows quickly`` and ``it can be shown that`` is, at best, filler, and, at worst, misleading as to the actual difficulty of the theorems you are alluding to.  look, i don't see why you need to be monkeying with this article, why don't you write an article on ore's invariants of the additive polynomials, or the moore determinant instead, hell, there is no entry for the vandermonde determinant even ...  or start the article on a carlitz module or drinfeld module instead, or fix the article on non-archimedean analysis which really needs a lot of work, cause its missing all that jazz ...    `",none

(45th) law of 1993, titled ``az önkényuralmi jelképek használatát tiltó törvény`` and it has been upheld in constitutional court.  if you fail to mention the very criminality of stalin and mao in the very header of their wiki articles, then you are looking for an edit war, period. we, the people of ex-soviet bloc countries are personally insulted when anglo-saxons pet ``uncle joe`` as the kind old leader. be glad he did not rule you (you may not have been born then with 10% probability because your father would get executed or die in the gulags beforehand, no kidding). acknowledge our sufferings by stating the truth: stalin was one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, period.  regards: tamas feher from hungary (etomcat@freemail.hu)`",none
"`  you are stalin apologets. where is placed the mention of katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish povs were shot by nkvd upon stalin's personal order? we hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so i find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of katyin very painful. stalin's crimes against poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. there is no excuse to the molotov-rippentropp pact. make no mistake that was the hitler-stalin pact.  i really wish stalin ruled you, not us. you are like rumsfeld, who met saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-khomeini iran war. when will you realize that putyin's current rule is an analog of stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's khodorkovski-yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the caucasian mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). thus, by not mentioning stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new uncle joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor russian race in great danger. a repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.  stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.  the entire wwii in europe would be over in 6-9 months had stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``the history of the great patriotic war 1941-1945``. you are plain stupid to praise stalin for a ``hard earned victory in wwii``.  so powerful was the fear of stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the free world.  in churches renovated after wwii (big destruction in hungary) the face of the satan (as defeated by arch-angel michael) is always of josif stalin's on wall paintings. people were shot for painting that.  regards: tamas feher.`",none

"   == ross perot and the reform party ==  i edited to include ross perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). he said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'perot voters'. on most issues he came to compromises between democrats and republicans with hard solutions. for instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. he also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. but he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.  the reform party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. people in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after pat buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.  which is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. i read noam chomsky once wrote that in america the groups on the fringes of politicslike nader on the left, buchanan on the right, and perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. a radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. the idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). that those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.  if you're talking about john mccain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). but he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. i was in the reform party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated mccain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his mccain-feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. the sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. if you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.  from what i know about uk politics, tony blair looks more like clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else.

"  == some personal observations here: == put a summary of it into the roots of christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  if the zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the egyptian especially since the hebrews were long associated with egypt back to the hyksos invasion.  it would be pov to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by akhenaten and adopted by the hebrews.  i myself don't know much about zoroaster, but i certainly recognise much of the egyptian issue and i'm more of a casual researcher.  it seems to me that zoroastrian elements are tied to the persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the egyptians have no basis when they long dominated palestine.  the greek pharaoh himself patroned the septuagint in alexandria.  i find the bigotry towards an egyptian root of christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the hamites of africa have not contributed anything and that the persians supposedly were/are white or considered japhethic as opposed to the semites.  seriously, this noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these afro-asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less white than the greeks and romans.  i consider persians to be semites because they are asian, in this context.  give it as much credence as the persian foundations and you will make this npov.  i seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of christianity and also delineating the greek root which provided roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  for instance, if the greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to philistines, rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with greece.  rome even rebuilt greek philistia as palestine and during the catholic crusades, it became the kingdom of jerusalem.  christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from europe and buddhist ties in southwest asia.    i myself used to be atheist or odinist not wanting to deal with what i percieved to be other peoples' culture and now i look in wonder at the historical background of the sea peoples and the subsequent graeco-roman expansion in the mediterranean sea.  there are european roots throughout the region now considered islamic or arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the library of alexandria.  just think of the term indo-european and you will understand alexander the great's empire.  see the connection between the european fylfot and indian swastika or the cross and the ankh?  please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  i am only stating things as i commonly have studied and heard of them.  i do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore i am not endorsing pov.  the various sources i have seen via google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  we are not to cast a pov on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  the existing article on the history of christianity provides the persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the egyptian or hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  after all, christianity had most of its evolution in non-persian areas of the mediterranean sea.  tell me, how many persian people are prominent in the christian world throughout its history?  what fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of persian elements in christianity, compared to the vast amount of greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire christian populace) and the nursery of christianity itself in egypt via the old testament(even jesus's infancy was spent in egypt, in safety from herod!)?  please, where is the background of christianity in persia besides 19th century racial studies?  like i've said, the noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for indo-aryan racist theories.

"ignoring the question of how long it will take to actually use it all up, i am prepared to concede the point that if the modern increase rate in co2 can be extrapolated to burning all known reserves then that would put us at about 700 ppm or less (2.5 times preindustrial levels).  now, there is a big if in there since we don't really know how existing carbon sinks like soils, forests, and the oceans will respond to increasing co2.  right now, these systems buffer the atmosphere so that the annual increase at mauna lao is actually significantly lower (by about 50%) than if you just calculate the increase expected from all the co2 humans dump into the atmosphere.  basically because co2 has increased, these systems draw down more co2 than they did in preindustrial times and hence partially offset our pollution.  some scientists think this buffer will become ever more effective as co2 rises, others think it will saturate and a substantially lower fraction of our waste will be absorbed.  obviously, such uncertainties are important for figuring out max co2. :::taking for the moment a value of 700 ppm as a reasonable end point, that still seems potentially bad.  how bad probably depends on how sensitive things like thermohaline circulation are to multiple degree changes in temperature, and how big a feedback is associated with retreating sea ice and permafrost.  not exactly a risk i am eager to take given existing climate uncertainties.  however, at face value it would seem to take some disasterous scenarios off the table.  for example, it is estimated that the wholesale deglaciation of antarctica won't occur till 3-3.5 times preindustrial co2 levels.  (this was presented at a conference of the american geophysical union, but i am having trouble finding a reference). :::i think your consideration of how high can co2 levels really get is a valid one, and potentially very intersting.  however, given the uncertainties involved in such estimates, i would really like to see if we can find something published on the issue.  an academic paper would (hopefully) have spent more time thinking through these issues and work out what kind of a range of values is possible. :::   ",none

"`  == wikipedia ``patricia cornwell`` page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes ==  the main wikipedia ``patricia cornwell`` page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. the page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.  demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates wikipedia's own policies.  the page is the alleged biography page for author patricia cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under cornwell's influence or on her payroll. these partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases cornwell.  i am patricia cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by cornwell.  the wikipedia main page on cornwell is a brief piece of pro-cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. a large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes cornwell committed against me.  as shown in court filings and public documents, cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. your wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.  patricia cornwell is a longtime friend of the president bush family and some fbi agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.  your wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. a few words of sycophantic praise for cornwell, and then a brief section on ``controversies`` which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.  you are invited to read cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, ``patricia cornwell biography: crime, bribery, scandal and mental illness``. researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.  it seems the main purpose of your current short wikipedia cornwell ``biography`` page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on cornwell.  i have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the cornwell partisans who control the wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.  the specific attacks on me in your wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with cornwell's hired thugs. regarding the specifics of these false statements:  the article accuses me of making public ``plagiarism`` accusations about cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. the wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. the wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the republican richmond times-dispatch newspaper by the cornwell lawyers themselves. the times-dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to patricia cornwell, and the ``reporter`` who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.  the actual facts are that i publicly criticized neo-nazi activities by cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that i be totally silent about her. the cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of ``plagiarism`` after cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.  the wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between cornwell's book and my earlier novel. but it does not disclose the fact that cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor",none

"`    there are many issues involved here, beyond what any individual might wish to see or not see, and the overall effectiveness, popularity, and usefulness of this project is i believe at stake.   the issue of the particular image in question has been closed for the time being, though curiously it was closed immediately after someone posted a note questioning the claim of its supposed ``free-use`` copyright status, which actually, to my knowledge had not been investigated. it is my understanding that the image is now ``safe`` from further debates about its inclusion for at least a month. i can accept this. i do not in any way accept the idea that the case, or the issues that it raises, are closed, and that myself or anyone should simply ``shut up`` about it.   on another issue that my activity has raised: i do generally deplore notifying people of things to which they have not expressed any indications of wanting to be involved with in any way, and whether for commercial, political,  or general social goals i would indeed consider that ``spamming``. i  would prefer to consider what i have done ``targeted campaigning`` upon an issue, in which a very strong and very clear consensus that had been indicated in no uncertain terms was certainly being ignored and evaded. very contrary to some people's  assessments and accusations against me, i had no intentions of keeping my actions secret, nor disguising them in any way. i actually expected people's reactions to them to further publicize the issue in question, and that is exactly what occurred.   to the minority of those who i contacted who were in any way offended by my attempts to notify them of what was occurring, i can and will apologize, and i ask their pardon. the responses that were generated would indicate that the majority did not feel that way. what i would consider genuine ``spamming``, or at least the most obnoxious extremes of it, is engaged in by people who are well aware that hundreds or thousands of people will be burdened and offended, for every one who might respond positively to their actions, much like the posters of these photographs, which most people do classify as hardcore pornography, normally limited to adults, including the providers of the images. from the main page of their site i have extracted these quotations (``bolding`` mine):   :see our site review in jane's sex guide hornyboy was rated ``quality and original porn``. check out the complete review in the new listings. feb '05   :this site contains images of naked men engaging in perverted sex acts, including autofellatio and gay sexual contact.

"`== text removed ==  in an appearance on abc news's nightline on march 15, 2005, michael schiavo cited the willingness that mrs. schiavo's parents expressed to keep her alive by any means necessary, including quadruple amputation if needed, as a key reason for denying transfer of guardianship to them.  :no, the transcript does not say that.  schiavo makes it quite clear that it has nothing to do with the schindlers.   schiavo: if i moved on with my life — and i moved on with a portion of it — but i still have a big commitment to terri. i made her a promise...and another reason why i won't give terri back is that mr. schindler testified in court, at the 2000 trial, that he would — to keep terri alive he would cut her arms and legs off and put her on a ventilator just to keep her alive...it's not about the money. this is about terri. it's not about the schindlers, it's not about the legislators, it's not about me, it's about what terri schiavo wanted. i am in the process of tracking down this testimony, as i recall reading parts of it in another article.   |   ::ok, here it is, from the december 2003 report to governor bush by dr. jay wolfson from the university of south florida: :::testimony provided by members of the schindler family included very personal statements about their desire and intention to ensure that theresa remain alive.  throughout the course of the litigation, deposition and trial testimony by members of the schindler family voiced the disturbing belief that they would keep theresa alive at any and all costs.  nearly gruesome examples were given, eliciting agreement by family members that in the event theresa should contract diabetes and subsequent gangrene in each of her limbs, they would agree to amputate each limb, and would then, were she to be diagnosed with heart disease, perform open heart surgery.  there was additional, difficult testimony that appeared to establish that despite the sad and undesirable condition of theresa, the parents still derived joy from having her alive, even if theresa might not be at all aware of her environment given the persistent vegetative state.  'within the testimony, as part of the hypotheticals presented, schindler family members stated that even if theresa had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it. throughout this painful and difficult trial, the family acknowledged that theresa was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state.  |   :::: uhm, how does mr. schindler saying that he would cut her arms and legs off not represent that statement? i'm not understanding where your quibble is... the testimony? the statement about amputation? ``a`` key reason vs. ``the`` key reason? please explain why you removed the text, as i'm not seeing a clear explanation.   :::::the editor wrote that the statement in question was a key reason for denying transfer of guardianship to them.  the transcript does not say that.  if anything, schiavo makes it clear that this is one reason directly connected to the schindler's inability (probably for religious reasons) to respect terri's wishes.  the quote in wolfson's report makes that clear, but schiavo only alludes to the testimony in the transcript.  also, michael schiavo further clarifies in the transcript that this is not about what he wants, but about what terri schiavo wanted.  the statement that was removed from the article attempted to distort these facts.  further, the statement by the schindlers has been put to rest on page 34 of wolfson's report:of the schindlers, there has evolved the unfortunate and inaccurate perception that they will ``keep theresa alive at any and all costs`` even if that were to result in her limbs being amputated and additional, complex surgical and medical interventions being performed, and even if theresa had expressly indicated her intention not to be so maintained. during the course of the gal's [guardian ad litem] investigation, the schindlers allow that this is not accurate, and that they never intended to imply a gruesome maintenance of theresa at all costs.   |    :::::: re-added text, with efforts to manage such issues, feel free to adjust as needed!    ::::::with respect to the statement that michael schiavo said in a transcript that ``this`` (ending her life) ``is not about what he wants, but about what terri schiavo wanted,`` it is important to note that he said exactly the opposite in a sworn deposit",none

"`  == movie reviews and pov == (i posted this on thegrza's talk page and am also posting it here as it deals with some of the issues you raise) ::`` the pov is inherent in these type of reviews the same way christian reviews are bound by their ideology instead of actually critiquing a film`` thegrza, i think you misunderstand our pov policy which applies to the content of the articles only, not to external links. first of all if we did not allow pov in external links we'd have to remove half the external links in wikipedia. secondly, all film reviews are, by definition, pov (i don't know of any reviews that don't express an opinion) so we'd have to remove all links to film reviews if npov applied to external links. we don't remove links simply because of the politics of the site linked to. i think you also misunderstand the concept of ``vandalism``. we can't simply throw around the term to justify removal of any material we don't like. it applies specifically to activity that disrupts wikipedia or disrupts an article. i've seen mim reviews quoted in harper's so they are actually relatively well known if only for their amusement value. there is no reason why we shouldn't have external links to christian film reviews or marxist film reviews. a broad variety of links is encouraged. what's discouraged are repetitive links to similar material (eg reviews from a dozen daily newspapers would be repetitive).   as to your point about ideology, i don't know if you've ever studied film theory in university or read academic journals on film such as cahiers des cinema but serious film criticism does actually deal with ideology, subtext etc and is not just the ``thumbs up`` ``thumbs down`` type review you see in a newspaper. by your argument we couldn't link to serious scholarly articles on films, many of which ``deconstruct`` films from a marxist, feminist, postmodern, or other ideological perspective. for instance, susan sontag's important and influential writings on film would be banned, by your argument, as they are ideological in nature and explore the subtext of films rather than simply being a technical critique.   hope this clarifies things.    ::specifically to curps, while i agree that linking to hundreds of mainstream reviews would be repetitive i see no problem with listing to a variety of reviews from different mainstream and non-mainstream viewpoints. whether or not a review is listed on ``rotten tomatoes`` is not really relevent as that site really only deals with popular mainstream reviews. indeed, by your criteria we could not link to serious scholarly critiques of films carried in scholarly journals. we do not determine the worthiness of links by how mainstream or popular they are. rather we look for diversity of opinions in our links.  `",none

"`  : i agree that some of the examples here are somewhat fluffy.  but emergence means slightly different things in different fields.  for example, while physicists use the term emergence, it doesn't have the same hype attached to it as the term does in the behavioural sciences.  it's simply used to mean a phenomenon or concept which only makes sense, or behaves in an expected way, at macroscopic scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales.  thus questions like ``is this electron hot or cold?  blue or green?  soft or hard?  smooth or rough?  solid or liquid?`` have little or no useful meaning, because these concepts are emergent and thus do not apply in this setting (or if they do apply, they behave unexpectedly and so one's intuition on the concept may be very misleading here).  that's a helpful thing to keep in mind, it lets one avoid any number of elementary errors when trying to understand particle physics, and thus does have a non-trivial amount of explanatory power.  as for mathematics (which is my own profession), i've almost never seen the term ``emergence`` used... the closest analogues seem to be the distinction between ``local`` and ``non-local`` (or ``global``) concepts, or between ``asymptotic`` and ``non-asymptotic`` behaviour.  it is true, i would classify most of the mathematical examples here as examples of non-local concepts rather than emergent ones.  if i have some time i might try to rework some of the mathematical material (which i was not involved in earlier).   `",none

"i agree with you. i am a chinese contributor to this site and i speak 3 chinese vernaculars and 3 european languages and through some of the unreasonable mandarinization imposed here, i feel how repressed non-native mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. in usa and europe, it is mostly by the cantonese, then subsequently the minnan-taiwanese and recently the people for fuzhou, wenzhou etc. as such, they will use han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like english. there is no standardised version until the northerners came into power and imposed mandarin on all the other chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. i think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the original, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the mandarin version. that will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes. thank you for being so interested in chinese culture. we need more friends like you. have a nice day.

"`it would be nice to know what are/were each nation's right-wing political parties, and whom from said parties became a leader of state.  18:08 apr 14, 2003 (utc)  == impartiality, please ==  this article, as it stands, has a rather blatant left-wing bias. for example, fascism is closely linked to right-wing thinking by only the third sentence! since fascism is a 'radical' ideology it would be anathema to anyone who regarded themselves as a  'conservative'. (furthermore, fascism advocates large, intrusive government, and therefore could be considered more akin to  left-, rather than, right-wing philosophy, which advocates the exact opposite.)  also: ``in theory anyone has an equal chance in a free market. however in practice, a free market is likely [...] to result in [...] almost all of the real ``power`` held by a small percentage of the population. hence, it can also be considered a doctrine of the right-wing.`` hence? *hence*? this seems to imply as /fact/ that a doctrine of the right-wing is that power should be held by a small percentage of the populationwhich is at best, a highly disputable opinion, at worst, a complete nonsense.  :i agree with this criticism.  economic ideology is better expressed somewhere else.  i've tried to rewrite it with a npov.  let me know your thoughts.   the article now seems to imply that ``right-wing`` is the same as ``conservative``, in the sense of resisting political change.  however i have the impression that right-wing is defined simply by opposition to left-wing doctrines, not opposition to change in general.  the leftist agenda is for government-mandated equality, in the mild version proposing equal rights for everybody under the law, followed by income redistribution through taxation, and in the extreme version progressing to communism.  e.g., if the left propose abolishing a monarchy, then anybody who opposes this is on the right, and is also conservative.  however if someone was to propose establishing a monarchy in a place where none ever existed, this would still be right-wing, but not conservative.  does this make any sense?     :the concepts of political ``left`` and ``right`` will always be difficult to define precisely, because they are inherently amorphous, but i would say it is unfair to categorize right-wing thinking as merely being in opposition to change from left-wingers.   :speaking from a right-wing perspective, i would say that right-wing ideology is fundamentally *pragmatic* in naturei.e. right-wingers believe that change should take place in terms of *reform* of existing institutions which evolved over aeons and have successfully stood the test of time. right-wingers are therefore naturally scornful of marxist/revolutionary ``idealists`` who believe in a ``year zero``, the discarding of all ``old`` ideas, and starting again from scratch (exemplified by such catastrophic failures stalin's five year plans, and mao's great leap forward and cultural revolution). in the case of the cultural revolution, 3000 years of chinese culture was chucked down the pan, by ``enlightened`` left-wing philosophersalthough this is an extreme example, most left-wingers aspire to re-invent society in some such manner, and this will always be opposed not only by those who revere the past, but by those who have any grasp of pragmatism.  :although libertarianism refuses to categorize itself as either left- or right-wing, i would say that many modern right-wingers are libertarian in nature, in that they believe in the freedom of the individual from the interference of the state, as opposed to the state-centric paternalistic view of the left. low taxation is a fundamental principle of the right, and low taxation necessarily results in a smaller role for government, and (it is argued) therefore greater individual freedom.  hmmm its difficult this right-left wing thing, it seems to be something you instinctively ``know`` whether something is left or right wing, but when you come to define it in detail it becomes very difficult.  there seems as far as i can tell, to be two different strands of right-wing politics which often contradict each other. there is a ``conservative`` right which generally opposes change from tradition, generally defends priveliged elites and wealthy interest groups, and opposes egalitarianism and is generally suspicious of rampant capitalism, often prefering protectionism, and favouring small business.  and there is the ``free market`` or ``radical`` right, who are perhaps best exemplified by say margaret thatcher or ronald reagan who often profess to believe in traditional values etc, but advocate radical free market policies of deregulation, privatisatio",none

"`  q.  how are the barrels rotated?  a.  the rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (a+b).  the motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the hydraulic drive assembly.  this in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  the forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the gau-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.  q.  how long is typical spin-up time?  a.  while the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  since the gau-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous.   on another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  during the firing of the gau-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  the engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be ``water washed`` (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  anyone who has had to clean an a-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.`",none

(the second looks australian, so it's not a strictly us-centric usage.)     ==arbitration==  thanks for pointing me in the direction of the rfa. a lot of familiar names in that crew! i don't know that i'd call them a cabal but i know what you mean. they've learned that the best way to push a pov is to gather a small gang. the way wikipedia is structured it's easy to subvert consensus by doing so. i'll try to have a look at what's passed and if i can comment constructively, i'll do that.    regarding arbitration, cheesedreams, i was not implying at all that i didn't agree that i should recuse myself  i did so, as i hope you noticed.  i was noting that it is arbitration committee practice for someone involved peripherally in a dispute (or directly, of course) to recuse themselves, and that in the past no one has needed to prompt arbitrators to do this.  we're intelligent, we're committed to fairness, and we police ourselves pretty effectively in this regard.  i was just wishing you'd have given me the courtesy of waiting to see if i would recuse myself from the case, rather than assuming i wouldn't.  i will note, though, that the standard you suggest is generally considered too high for arbitration here.  in a case like yours, it's obvious that with so many involved parties (in a relatively small community), all of those people will know at least one arbitrator  mere acquaintance does not require an arbitrator to recuse.  we recuse when we're involved in the case itself, or when one of the involved parties is either a long time enemy or close friend.  if arbitrators could only hear cases involving users they had never before encountered, we couldn't arbitrate any case effectively.  just thought i'd offer my thoughts, and let you take them as you please.  on another note, i am not sure if it was you who wrote the phrase ``cabal of 'fundamentalists'`` in your arbitration request, but if you did, i'd suggest to you that it might be wise not to use that phrase.  the list of users who oppose you includes at least one very dedicated atheist and at least one other person who is openly hostile to christianity  characterizing the list as ``fundamentalist`` will be seen as a blanket generalization.  obviously you can do as you please, but i think other users will notice the word and the users, as i did, and be confused or else draw negative assumptions (i.e., characterizing atheists as ``fundamentalists`` might be seen as an indication that one is hasty to judgment, etc.).  now, i'm sure you don't much like getting a note from me, so i'll disappear, but if you ever do feel like talking, i want you to know that i'd be happy to.  as i hope you can see above, i'm not ``out to get you``.  i'd like to understand you a little better, and i'd like to be able to work with you productively if i can.  if you'd like to talk about it, drop me a .  thanks,    :unlike most of the arbitration committee, as far as i am aware, you have actually engaged in debate over controversial issues with me. i regard that as being ``an involved party``.    :no, i wrote the phrase 'cabal of ``fundamentalists``', please note the quotes around the word ``fundamentalist`` :i have absolutely no issue with getting a note from you.   ::i'm glad  here's another note then.  you seem to misunderstand me (perhaps i'm not communicating well).  i have agreed with you on two separate pages already that i most certainly am an involved party.  i don't want to sound at all rude, but i have to admit that your continued responses to me are making me wonder if you understand what i mean when i say that i have ``recused`` myself from the case.  if i am wrong, please forgive my suggestion.  but if you are unclear on what it means, it means that i have openly declared that i am an involved party and that i will not offer any arbitrator opinions (or any votes) on your case, should it be accepted.  i apologize if it is unclear  i had thought that ``recuse`` was common in the english court system as well, but i confess i do not know it well, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  as far as the quotation marks around ``fundamentalist``...well, as i said, it's your choice.  i can't claim that i understand what difference in meaning is implied by the quotes, but i don't suppose it's important for me to understand.  thanks for replying nicely  i apprecia",none

[1) that do not affect local government; 2) as for representation in national parlament - polish districts ussually shows smallest participation in elections  (which is not what you would expect from discriminated people)] ::according to what i read in polish press, lithuanian gvt changed borders of districts so region with polish majority was divided and added to regions with lithuanian majorities, so in effectc poles lost representation in local government szopen * transcription of names and family names that are written in lithuanian [please name the country there this is not a case] :in regions where 100% population is polish they still have to call themselves with those funny endings in administrative offices; and the greatest polish poet is not mickiewicz but mickiewiczius ???

"`  ::what about the point that there are valid non ``race`` or ``genetics`` ways of describing the issue? instead of ``presumably`` how about something like ``no scientific basis/consensus``? the ``thrive/environment`` point probably should mention nutrition and other possible environmental causes?  the paragraph still suffers from the same problem of framing the issue exclusively in terms of ``race`` or ``genetics`` which is not right, all possible causes should describe the issue using their own descriptive terms. why does the proposed paragraph also try to sneakily describe ``intelligence`` only in terms of ``genetic potential``? is the author of the paragraph arguing that ``genetic potential`` is the only valid way of describing ``intelligence`` now too? what is the scientific basis for such an argument? the above paragraph is much more subtle (nice try) but is still riddled with the same errant exclusive framing of the issue around ``race`` or ``genetics``.  1 july 2005 05:08 (utc)`",none

(just a proposal.  i'm not sure of precedent or what the current convention is leaning towards right now.)  .   ::i'm just concerned that that might sound ambiguous - and someone is bound to jump up and down about a perceived ambiguity!    :::you have a good point.  i meant ``leader-as-in-an-executive-office-holder-or-similar-position,`` not ``leader-as-in-role-model.``  for me, ``leader of afghanistan`` pretty clearly refers to the person calling the shots, and not, say, other members of the interim government or to anyone in any leadership role over there.  but i acknowledge the ambiguity.i think we're stuck.  english doesn't have a single clear, unambiguous phrase for the person in charge — it depends on when and where they're in charge.  if i had to choose between ``heads of state`` and ``heads of government``, i would choose the latter over the former every time, even if that meant listing leaders who, in their days, were not heading what we would now call a government.  .   ==logos== (regarding the copyright status and appropriate tag for media:wikimedia.png and related images)  it's gfdl but it's also a trademark, so can't be used in the same way as most other gfdl images. the same is true of all our logos other than the mediawiki one which i think is pd. i was going to point you to m:logos but i just realized that page is missing all the copyright information as well. i'll try to get it clarified.   :thanks.  i've replied on your .  .   ==thanks== thanks for the birthday greetings (though it's still not till tomorrow here).  surely that should be at wikipedia:list of wikipedians by birthday?  )    *page created.  feel free to humiliate others by tricking them into revealing their birthdays and then listing them therein.  .   ==link spamming== ardonik - i got your message about link spamming (131.191.72.23), and i'm a bit taken aback.  you've mistaken my information site for a personal blog site, and removed all of the relevant external links i added.  i really am glad that people like you are watching out for the quality of information here, i just think that you were a bit zealous on my part.  i admit that i write my own content, and i'm trying to share it with others; but i contest that the links i added were relevant   *on the state songs page, after the listing for ``you are my sunshine``, i added a link to my performance of the song (available for free).  perhaps it would be more appropriate to upload the song ?  create a page just about the song ?  i'm not sure, but i imagined that readers might want to hear the song. *on the weblog page, i added a listing of sites where a person could get a blog for free.  i'll admit that my site has free blogs, and was on the list, but is the information not useful ? *and then the origami page, which i added a link to the book i've been writing with detailed origami instructions.  why would you delete that, when there are four other sites in the list that i tacked mine on the end of ?  i spend a decent amount of time making sure that if i add anything to wikipedia, it is useful.  honestly, i am motivated to integrate my website into the internet, but i try very hard to make sure that i",none

"  == historical works of isaac asimov, a historiographical analysis ==  i, historian     stephen: “but you are telling me, susan, that the ‘society for humanity’ is right; and that mankind has lost its own say in its future.”  susan: “ it never had any, really. it was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand – at the whims of climate, and the fortunes of war. now the machines understand them; and no one can stop them as they are dealing with the society, - having as they do, the greatest of weapons at their disposal, the absolute control of our economy.”  stephen: “how horrible!”[1]                 the author of this dialogue is isaac asimov. similar references to the history of humanity are widely used in his literature works. the author is a well-known writer of future societies, not only in fiction but also as treatises of the ‘march of humanity’ into the future. neither in his stories, nor in the historical essays of asimov can one easily find references to great changes in a society through the works of great men, great ideas or greatness of an arbitrary institution. this paper will investigate the historiographical method and mode of historical writing of isaac asimov.      the writer:  seldom thought of as a scientist, less even as an essayist, and almost never as a historian. the famous author of some of the best-known science fiction literature... hailed as a “grand master” in 1986 by the science fiction and fantasy writers of america inc., isaac asimov has produced over 470 books on a large variety of subjects[2]. among his portrayals as a writer are, as listed by one of his publishers houghton mifflin company, novelist, humorist, futurist, current world record holder in literary output etc. yet, more importantly asimov was a phd holder in the field of chemistry, a professor in boston university. more relevant still for the purpose of the present work is the historian persona that asimov assumed numerous times.[3]                asimov was born in january 2, 1920 in petrovichi, russia to a jewish family that emigrated to the united states. he grew up in brooklyn and graduated from columbia university in 1939, obtaining his phd in the same establishment in 1948. he joined the faculty of boston university thereafter, and remained associated to b.u., however not in a teaching capacity from 1958 on. he died in 1992, his death was later revealed to have been as a result of contracted hiv from a bypass surgery he received in 1983[4].               despite the fact that there are various different elements to his character, asimov was a writer first and foremost. his first publications were in the genre of science fiction, first of which was published in an issue of amazing stories magazine in march 1939. asimov claims that writing had been “ . . . merely an amusement,” and that he had hoped for a few dollars to help pay his college tuition.[5] furthermore, for the introduction of his one hundredth work, he professes that he had never planned anything at all in his writing career, and that his commercial success was an “incredulous relief.” as for his historical works he claims that they were “primarily intended for non-historians,” as his science books were primarily intended for non-scientists.               he is not only an amateur that has deep interests in history, but also a science-fiction novelist, whose literature work is influenced by his knowledge of history. asimov’s major works, the foundation and robot series to name a few, depict the future not through the wars and technological accomplishments of humanity but they portray the human societies of the future, with a dominant preconception of formation and function of the past societies. to name a specific case; he declares that the fictitious galactic empire that is in power in the foundation series were written with certain periods of the roman history; “justinian and belisarus of the sixth century and a little bit tiberius and sejanus of the first century…” to be exact, in mind.[6]      the works:  isaac asimov is interested in history not only out of personal curiosity, but he can also justify this curiosity in terms of his profession. asimov states; “… we surely cannot grasp the significance of population, energy, technology, and other subjects today without seeing them in the context of the past.” therefore as a professional author of science fiction, and a speculator of future societies, asimov believes that “… without knowing where we came from, we cannot easily detect where we are going.”[7]              his outlook of history is pre-deterministic and conceptualized materialistically; and for the most part simplistically. in dealing with the rise and fall of political unities, he ofte",none

"`  -  i'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.  i don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a pnrs is caused by some intelligence, another pnrs is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third pnrs is probably caused by some intelligence. there are unknown possible ways to generate a pnrs, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. this feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. so, they pressure the upper management of nasa to launch outside the designed safe range. this happened a number of time without problem. at some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. this continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. if you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. it could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the pnrs was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third pnrs. this is playing on a ``gut feeling`` that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of ``pattern`` and bet based off of that, on the ``gut feeling`` that the roullette wheel has some bias. they may even win a few times. but the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any ``patterns`` is purely coincidental.  `",none

"`  ::indeed numerous iranian media pointed that out right away.  that is why i support the idea of including ``jewish`` at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  it is not to ``single out`` pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both iranian media as well as officials from foreign ministry have called it a part of the on-going zionst smear campaign against iran.   pilz' ``early anouncements``,  had claimed that both final candidates of the iranian presidency were mentioned in his ``extraordinarily reliable agent d`` report.  so no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   he had anticipiated that rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on rafsanjani.  as an iranian, i also feel this is coordinated. it is indeed hard to explain how the major western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. how could for example, ap, reuters and afp all three make the same mistake at the same time? and it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  so multiple news agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  and i have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-iran smear reports.  also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-zionist stance.  i don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary ``contributors`` to the same  smear campaign because they view islamic iran as a threat to zionism.  the same people also have an ``interest`` on the rafsanjani article and probably many other iran-related articles.  `",none

"`  hi again bo [will just use the abbreviation for speed], not much time at the moment since i'm in the midst of a project but wanted to respond to a few points. first of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of  irritation. i do think that wikip should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. you and others have referred vaguely to the ``process`` of copyvio review, but i have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims. 1. i sometimes find a ``you have a message waiting`` notice. how is that genrated? do you get this same notice when i post on your user page? is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won't be visible to the world  e.g. if i needed to provide you an email address or something i didn't want posted here? 2. regarding crapsey. i did indeed check various sources in writing the article. and if you read the eb citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. it differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than eb. moreover, crapsey is a local legend in rochester, and i had no need to consult brittanica  i don't know how you folks access eb, but i stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides ``teaser`` articles that are virtually useless. thus, the entry non-members get for crapsey is the following truncated info: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocid=9125441 we have never been eb ``trial`` members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at wikip do have some sort of membership, however. is that correct? 3. regarding sock puppetting, i was adapting your own wikip term for those who use ``dummy`` accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. it was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a revert war. in fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet william heyen  they kept copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, exit online. when i pointed this out, i was told, in effect, ``oh yeah? well, prove it!```` i have no idea what sort of ``proof`` one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). more to the point, they offered no suggestions as to how one might ``prove it.`` if you have an email address for someone at wikip who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her. 4. as for ``my article,`` i was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that i authored it. in fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a gfdl license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. that could even be the whole article. for this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the gfdl requirements for their own writing - the gfdl license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. they can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have. 5. thanks for your candor over concerns about eb suits over copyright. maybe eb has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor wikip, though i somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same ``new posting`` info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. it would take an army of staff even to randomly check wikip listings. 6. as for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and i do have accounts and would, indeed, like the ``credit`` for our efforts. however, given the recent unpleasant incidents we've encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, i'm sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment. 7. i'll have to check into templates. i suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why using forms can be so dangerous.  `",none

(so where does this ``extra harmonic power`` go, if it is not sent out to the speaker or dissipated in the output filter ? it is temporarily stored in the filter, in the capacitors and inductors. at some instants, energy flows *into* the filter, charging the capacitors and ___ing the inductors. at other instants, energy flows ``backwards`` from the filter, through the class-d amplifier, back into the power supply. this is why class-d amplifiers need a lot more/bigger capacitors on their power supply than other classes.)      `",none
"`  == more on protocols/procedures/courtesy ==  hi bov, thanks so much for your kind reply. our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though, so i thought i'd continue under a new heading. hope you have no objection. i'm still under the gun with that project i mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...i'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to. 1. regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and ``your editorial colleagues``, yes, you're right. i guess i don't know enough about wikip yet, but i clearly don't have access to the same ``additional facilities`` (which i take to mean ``tools``) as you, so i don't have the same control. sure, i could put a copyvio on someone's page, but i rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  i assume copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. from what you say above, it appears that some uber admin(s) makes the final determination. 2. also regarding ``tools`` i and, i suspect, most wikip contributors have no power to lock and page to insure it doesn't get reverted by anyone else. nor can we delete a page, even our own. nor do we have access, as i assume you do, to eb and other pay services to check for likely infringements. there are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. perhaps you also have access to those? you didn't indicate how that eb page was accessed since the public can only get the ``teaser`` entry for crapsey. thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: ``we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!`` 3. regarding your statement that it's ``actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,`` are you saying that once a copyvio is pointed out, the ``offending contributor`` simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! that's truly astouonding  i'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be. have no idea what you mean by ``the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page.`` can you point me to a sample of this? 4. regarding your statement that ``he eb page i'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? referenced by whom? by your colleague? or are you obliquely saying that wikip has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and recent url lists to determine where they've been?! i know i didn't reference eb and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that wikip can somehow monitor member hard drives, i'd find that very disturbing...an outright privacy violation. will run adaware & spybot s&d; just to see if anything they regard as ``malicious`` turns up with wikip fingerprints on it! ;-)  5. on your reply to 3 above that ``wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' `` i'm confused. the passage i quoted suggests that the authors are granting wikip a gfdl ``license,`` which, from my understanding of the law, means ``with permission.`` the author still ``owns`` the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from wikip, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to wikip. 6. regarding your answer to 5 above that you ``don't have access to any special posting info. it's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,`` this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and i guess i'm confused again. how in the world would admins and other ``watchers`` like you (still don't know what your title is) know ``what's new`` on wikip if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? if so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another? again, thanks. will try and get back later or tomorrow.  `",none

"`  ::wrong again.  so far you have only based your claim on a web site.  iranica does not say that aryanem vaejo is in afghanistan, nor does iranica say that any part of afghanistan has ever been called ariana.  if it does, paste the exact quote here with a link to that article.  the association of afghanistan and ``ariana`` for the first time in history appeared after world war ii and this includes the name for their airlines ``ariana airlines``.  you seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. this is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. your parents have produced a foolish mr. know it all who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  this is stupid.  i have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. tell me which of the following points is wrong: :::1- no reputable scholar has ever claimed that aryanem vajo is in afghanistan.    :::2- one scholar, the late professor bahram farahvashi, who dedicated his life to iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning dictionary of pahlavi language, has a book by the title of ``iran vij`` which is precisely about aryanem vaejo which zereshk claims to be afghanistan. according to this book, as well as other scholars, aryanem vaejo is next to the caspian sea.  farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that aryanem vaejo is next to the aral sea.  in no case anybody has suggested it is in afghanistan.  :::3- in at least three of the achaemenids inscriptions (by darius i and his son xerxes) where they mention the word arya  (that is, the old persian word arya) in the same inscription they also mention haraiva (modern day herat which was recorded as ``aria`` in greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  the two words are distincly different words with different spellings.  only due to the greek rendering of haraiva as aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after world war ii, because someone found a way to associate afghanistan with ``aryan`` and others picked it up.)  :::4- unlike what zereshk claims, encyclopedia iranica does not say that afghanistan is the same as aryanem vaejo nor does it anywhere say that afghanistan has ever been called ``ariana``.  :::5- show me one authentic source from before world war ii, that shows any part of afghanistan has ever been called ``ariana`` or ``aryana``.  just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and not afghani web sites from the 21st century.  by repeating that the ``official afghanis website says so`` you only show how weak your argument is.  :::5- last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] ``the official position of the islamic republic of afghanistan``  well, that is not good enough.  wikipedia is an encyclopedia not the official website of afghanistan.  what ``the official position of the islamic republic of afghanistan`` is irrelevant here.  we are interested in correct information.  `",none

"`  == america's failed federal criminal justice system. ==  dateline:  21 july 2005 23:45est washington, dc usa   == america's failed federal criminal justice system. ==   by:  mark a. varca, chief information officer, fedcure.  fedcure is the world's leading advocate for america's, ever growing, federal inmate population. on behalf of the board of directors, we would like to extend an invitation to each of you to join us in our efforts to reform the federal criminal justice system in the united states. federal cure, incorporated, is a nonprofit organization that, inter alia, deals largely with the issues faced by federal inmates and their loved ones.   we are working to reinstate parole; increase good time allowances;  provide for compassionate releases; restore pell grants; and opportunities for successful reentry  into the community, for all federal offenders; and promote a system that incarcerates fewer people and provides humane conditions for those who are incarcerated or under post-incarceration supervision via parole or supervised release. over 45,000 people were released from federal prison in the united states last year.  on this day, the united states federal bureau of prisons houses 185,100+ people.  most serving long, non parolable, sentences for non violent offenses.  please consider, if you have not already, joining and contributing to fedcure.  we are the world's leading experts in matters relating to federal inmates.  collectively, five of fedcure's 14 board members have over 50 years of in prison experiencebehind the fenceas former federal inmates.   each holding j.d.'s, two holding ll.m's and two holding ph. d's.  our lifetime members include the best criminal attorneys in the united states.  .  ``martha stewart's incarceration has made her the diva of federal criminal justice reform in the united states.``  mrs. stewart wrote from prison in a december 2004 letter posted on her web site, ``i beseech you all to think about these [inmates] - to encourage the american people to ask for reforms, both in sentencing guidelines, in length of incarceration for nonviolent first-time offenders, and for those involved in drug-taking.``  the synergies behind that have yet to unfold.  however, we can state with confidence that, when all the discussions settle on the table concluding that the federal criminal justice system in the united states is undoubtedly broken and in need of reform; and that after all of the discussion about what's wrong with the system and what can be done to fix it comes to rest, in the end, it always comes down to one important reform issue:  to reduce federal prison sentences.  in today's political environment, however, there is only one possible hope that would best accomplish this reform:  enact federal legislation to revive our former system of parole for federal prisoners; and to provide new re-entry opportunities for people being released from prison.   to that end, fedcure is feverishly advocating in favor of  h.r. 3072 (former h.r. 4036, as amended) a bill to revive the system of parole for federal prisoners, that was introduced, in the 109th congress, by the honorable u.s. representative, danny k. davis (d) of illinois on 27 june 2005.     parole of federal offenders began after enactment of legislation on june 25, 1910.  under the comprehensive crime control act of 1984, the united states parole commission retained jurisdiction over defendants who committed their offenses prior to november 1, 1987.  at the same time, the act provided for the abolition of the parole commission on november 1, 1992.  the phase out of the commission has been extended by statute several times. the status of the commission beyond november 1, 2005 remains unresolved despite the commission having taken over supervision of all dc offenders in addition to the remaining 4,000 old law offenders.  presently, the commission has over 100 employees and a budget of over $10 million.   h.r. 3020, introduced on 22 june 2005, seeks ``to extend the existence of the u.s. parole commission.  when the u. s. sentencing guidelines were imposed for federal defendants whose criminal activities took place subsequent to november 1, 1987, parole was eliminated.  early release was limited to approximately 47 days of good time each year and the sentences themselves were increased appreciably.  the majority of federal inmates are non-violent low-level drug offenders with very long sentences.  moreover, the majority of this segment of the federal inmate population is being incarcerated for the first time. thousands of people in prison are serving life sentences for non-violent offenses without the possibility of parole.  the vast majority of these people are also first time offenders.    ni",none

"`   in the ``findings and declarations of fact`` of the united states congress in passing the subversive activities control act of 1950, in 50 u.s. code chapter 23 subchapter iv sec. 841, states that,  ``the congress finds and declares that the communist party of the united states, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the government of the united states...the policies and programs of the communist party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders...members of the communist party are recruited for indoctrination with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and disciplined to carry into action slavishly the assignments given them...the communist party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations upon its conduct...gives scant indication of capacity ever to attain its ends by lawful political means. the peril inherent in its operation arises not from its numbers, but from its failure to acknowledge any limitation as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional government of the united states ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence. holding that doctrine, its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the united states. it is the means whereby individuals are seduced into the service of the world communist movement, trained to do its bidding, and directed and controlled in the conspiratorial performance of their revolutionary services.  `",none

"did christians invent satan. the idea that christians invented satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of wicca and other pagan believers, we see that the holy scriptures that came from judaism has a book called job, so why blame the christians!, rather the scriptures reveals in genesis how eve was tempted by the serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that david is tricked into taking a census by satan (old testament 2 samuel) later on further we see that jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of beelzebul (satan) by pharisees, jesus refutes the accusations of the pharisees. in the nt we hear that i saw satan cast out of heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the west. so also in revelations we hear that there was war in heaven and st. michael and all the loyal angels to god fought against the followers of satan and the battle was won by the good angels, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! also elsewhere we hear that satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. christ was tempted by the shaitan 3 times after his baptism in the desert. so to say that we christians invented something which was already revealed in judaism and ot is silly and obnoxious. the devil had pride, then disobedience, then jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that jesus called the satan a liar, murderer and thief. why dont the wiccans look to zoroastriaism or other dualistic religions and see the concept of good versus evil in those religions? why, so that the christians get the blame for something that actually exists. even the muslim believe in a the serpent called iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the evil one called mara, who was a tempter. jesus even spoke to st. peter and said that the devil had been given permission to sift st. peter like wheat, whereby jesus siad that he had prayed for cephas such that he would not enter into temptation. the truth seems to be that the devil was an arc angel in heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe god created man in his own image, god requests all the angels to bow to adam, all do except for one angel (later called lucifer). he refuses based on himself being made of fire and that adam is made of clay, however, god allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in job, some mention that in isaiah: o lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the heavenn is a direct reference to the devil, but i also consider it to babyloon, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is babylon the great etc. revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. god has talks with the satan, so satan can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as god does not talk to non-entities. also some people believe that the dark side of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. i know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'ha, jesus you nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! so far as i concerned the truth is in the holy bible, some truth is also in the quran. there are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is christ and the books of ot and nt are inspired by the holy spirit. have a read of revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from god!   enough of this rubbish about christian inventions of spirits. pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.  jews and christians had the opposite, god revealed to them the truth and the way, and the life.  thanks email: james_hernon@hotmail.com the next seion is not written by me (james hernon)   ",none

"  == chemical abortion ==  anon changed this section to: chemical abortion, which comprises 10% of all abortions in the united states and europe, is a method used to induce abortion by ingesting drugs, usually during the first nine weeks of pregnancy. chemical abortion is accomplished by administering either methotrexate or mifepristone (ru-486) followed by administration of misoprostol. approximately eight percent of these abortions require surgical follow-up, usually by vacuum aspiration (see below). methotrexate may also treat undiagnosed or concomitant tubal pregnancies, or assist women who have spontaneously aborted.  a common misconception is that emergency contraception, commonly known as the morning-after pill, sold under the brand name plan b, causes an abortion. this is medically inaccurate, since emergency contraception only works before pregnancy begins. pharmacologically, emergency contraception is identical to ordinary hormonal contraceptives, and work to prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation, inhibiting sperm motility, and possibly by making the uterine lining less hospitible to implantation. emergency contraception has no effect on an existing pregnancy, and must be taken within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse, though it is most effective if taken as soon as possible. intrauterine devices, also known as iud's, can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse as well.  not going to rv this one because of wp:3rr, but i think it needs work. the content is pretty good, but the prose needs to be neutralized.

"`  == some factual background on the subject that might speak to the credibility of the idea ==  'logan darrow' is actually doug 'logan darrow' clements.  he added the logan darrow to his name a few years ago.  after graduating from university of rochester's mba program in the late 80s, he went to the pacific northwest and tried a corporate job for about 6 months before departing.  he started a magazine, american venture capital exchange, that had a modest amount of success matching entrepreneurs with investors.  he sold the magazine a few years ago and since then he has been trying to get his tv show, the lexington league, off the ground.  in my opinion, the lexington league is basically a free-market, pro-liberty version of 60 minutes.  doug will disagree and point out the subtle ways that it is different.  i won't dispute the differences but i do think they are subtle.  he ran for ca governor in the recall election in order to generate publicity for his tv show.  he finished 5th from the bottom.  fast forward to late june of this year.  i sent an email to approximately 6 of my buddies, including doug, suggesting that we use eminent domain to take souter's house from him in order to tear it down and erect a mansion, which would be assessed and taxed at a higher rate.  i later morphed this idea to be a bed and breakfast.  in the email, i specifically referenced getting another of my friends involved because he is one of the country's leading experts on property rights and takings.  doug sent me an email saying that it was a great idea and i would receive ``100% of the credit`` (not that i want or need the credit).  he created the press release and sent it out and after being interviewed on about 10 radio shows and getting 380,000 hits on his website, he sent me another email acknowledging his indebtedness to me for the idea.  however, he has avoided any public acknowledgement that the idea was anyone's except his own and he has declined to take advantage of my contacts including the aforementioned attorney as well as a friend of a friend who is a real estate developer.  this leads me to believe that he is not serious about the use of eminent domain against souter and he is really interested in getting people to mail him money and increasing the public's awareness of his tv show.  this is my conclusion.  you are welcome to draw your own.`",none

"  reply: many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants (fabric relaxers, fabric conditioners).    aiui too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers [please confirm].  the cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.  similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures (eg 80 celsius).  however it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.  do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.  there does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.  again, some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers.  i would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.  some distributors will suggest the use of bleach (eg 3m and its scotch-brite microfiber kitchen cloths) and others will specify rather high temperatures.  perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but i am not sure how it could have been achieved.  http://www.microfiber-products-online.com/faqs.html",none

"`  basically, the multi-propose approval voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. the result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as irpen wishes with ``approve & oppose``. the only basic structural weakness of approval voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. but even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write ``weak approve`` or ``strong approve`` when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. however, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. she simply is difficult. there are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. and thus the vote splits. this being the basic situation, no voting system will ever cure it - unless using ``violence``. of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc. personally, i am somewhat puzzled why not a higher number of people came and put their (perhaps secondary, or label ``weak``) approval to ``alexandra of hesse`` - but that is the result of the will of those voters.  `",none

why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? what does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? do you have some personal animus towards rose? please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. it's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. it's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -   ::i've copied this discussion to the talk:biff rose page. -   :: any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. that rose was in time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. that he wrote a song that was covered by both tiny tim and david bowie is. that that song was co written oscar winning musician paul williams is important. also of note, it should be mentioned that rose has disavowed the williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying william's own involvement in the song. but a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. as for rose's appearnaces on carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. he alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. producerss from the tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` of note> rose was banned from any more performances on the tonight show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by paul newman's uncle, joseph newman. this was chalked up to rose's irrascible nature. i think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. i did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.   ==greetings==  greetings and welcome to wikipedia. please excuse the rude treatment you've received from the administrator who has engaged most of your attention thus far. he has a bad habit of disregarding wikipedia:please do not bite the newcomers, especially where a newcomer has made edits to an article or subject he deems to be his territory. you should not let a hostile reception deter you from participating here and i hope you will stay. while editing i encourage you to review wikipedia's policies and guidelines located here. please make a good faith attempt at abiding by each, and if you believe that another user you have encountered is not doing so a proper recourse is to inform him/her of it. thanks and welcome once again.    :i don't think that this is a new user. -   ::a hunch that somebody's a returnee, absent clear proof, is no basis to harass him or her. unless you have proof and are prepared to make a case of it, please assume good faith.    :::i'm not harassing anyone. i came to his talk page to ask him to not delete material from an article.  the fact that he is using a different username today didn't seem like sufficient reason to call out the welcome wagon. but you go right ahead if you like. cheers, -   == revert warning ==  you are in danger of violating the three revert rule. please cease further reverts or you may be blocked from further editing. -   == read this ==  willmcw, i understadn yo uare trying to avoid vandalism, but by manipulating this site into your view you promote fascism.  my edits are good on the subject of biff rose.  look at his website, research his recordings. time magazine has written numerous articles, are these mentioned in other wiki posts... no. so why here?  as for rose's self released recordings, i did a favor to you by listing them. are other performers non accesible recordings listed? no.  do a better job editing and less of one policing because you stink at it.  == redirect ==  the article at biff rose is improperly-titled because it is not capitalized correctly. please leave it as a redirect to the properly-named article. thank you. -   == what the? ==  hey, why are you reverting my edits and removing the photo of biff rose? i found a separate article on the same topic (where you seemed to be the main author), incorporated the main points from it in an attempt to mege them. someone later redirected it.  why are you deleting my additions?    however much i abhor racism, anti-semitism, etc. i think that whatever biff rose currently espouses seems more like it should be taken with a grain of salt. not quite the same as david duke.  i have no problem with these things outlined in his bio, but it should really not have the form as something showing a personal point of view.  it seems like the way the article was, was fairly balanced, showing both old and new aspects of the artist.  and let the quotes and links speak for themselves.  why did you remove all that other stuff which you deem extraneous, by the way? having the name of some songs and collaborators seems rather harmless.  but anyway, i don't really have any particular agenda in the matter, i just don't like random deletions of what i write.     hey man, you have got to get a more broad sided view of the reality. what your writing only proves that you are a sock puppet for the rose crew, and that you are unable to realize that wikipedia is a group process and that your words will be eidted no matter what, it's the nature of the beast. if you don't like the process move to some other site that protects your version of relaity as the truth. good luck finding that place, brainiac. steve   ==username== someone created a user page for you claiming that you were ``a vandal who had a beef with one of the real steve espinolas``. i've deleted it. best wishes,     it was at , with the content ``steve espinola`` is the name of at least four real people. the wikipedia user calling himself ``steve espinola,`` however, is a vandal who has a beef with one of the real steve espinola's.  signed,  a real steve espinola, brooklyn, ny.``  it was created by an anonymous user. best wishes,     :can you verify that your name is really ``steve espinola``?

"`  == my thoughts on the scrabble word list ==  i understand the opinion of many is that i messed these lists up, but in my opinion this is not the case. not only does the list now contain many more, genuine words than it used to, but i've incorporated the definitions, stated the irregular plurals, such as qawwal hooked by i, and so on. to me it seems the only genuine concern with the new page is capital letters. knowledge of irregular plurals such as fuqaha is useful, as is the fact that somehow we must categorize or otherwise sort these words so that they have a genuine meaning, a genuine context, which others can believe, research or add to.  i've already said to others, if they feel the words should be in lower case go ahead and do so (i was hoping i could get these words up in courier or some other consistently spaced font, but this appears to be impossible, thus meaning i would further understand the wish to make these words lower-case). and i'll consistently make my case that these words do exist, i've cited my sources, and the justification for the fact that each of these words exists. yes, i'll admit that words like bathqol (which i'm happy writing in lower case for now), draw very few google hits, but i was writing from an amalgamation of sources melded into an individual source, which is justification enough for me that they should be included in this list. i hope you think this is okay. i'm going to ask  whether he would update his opinion as stated on the talk page.  meanwhile, i am of the opinion that, although perhaps obscure to some, the dictionaries i have cited are genuine dictionaries, with genuine words and should be treated as such. please respond with your opinions.  ps. maybe as i have earlier in this statement, the right thing to do would be to reproduce the list in bold lower case, rather than regular upper case, so as to upset fewer people. |edits`",none

"`i've included a passage of the bible on my user page. i want it to open the page, and will keep it here, because i feel it acentuates the writing that follows.  so, without any further ado, here is some biblical goodness.  the best things have been culminated  zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured  by others, deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold entertainment in the world.  it is welcomed  with suspicion instead of love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole left for cavil to enter, (and  cavil, if it do not find a hole, will make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.  this will easily  be granted by as many as know story, or have any experience.  for, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of  newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying, or opposition?  a man would think that civility,  wholesome laws, learning and eloquence, synods, and church-maintenance, (that we speak of no more things of this kind)  should be as safe as a sanctuary, and out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor dog move his  tongue against the motioners of them. for by the first, we are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; by the  second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by  violence; by the third, we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling that we have attained unto  ourselves; briefly, by the fourth being brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our differences than by  writings which are endless; and lastly, that the church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and  conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing  fathers and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts  again themselves do hang to receive the spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and support fit for their estates.  thus it is apparent, that these things which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none, either without  absurdity can speak against them, or without note of wickedness can spurn against them.  yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [anacharsis with others] have been brought to untimely death for  none other fault, but for seeking to reduce their countrymen to god order and discipline; and that in some commonwealths  [e.g. locri] it was made a capital crime, once to motion the making of a new law for the abrogating of an old, though the  same were most pernicious; and that certain [cato the elder], which would be counted pillars of the state, and patterns of  virtue and prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way to good letters and refined speech, but bare  themselves as averse from them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; and fourthly, that he was no babe, but a great clerk  [gregory the divine], that gave forth (and in writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he gave forth,  that he had not seen any profit to come by any synod, or meeting of the clergy, but rather the contrary; and lastly, against  church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the ambassadors and messengers of the great king of kings should be  furnished, it is not unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better by the reporter himself [nauclerus],  though superstitious) was devised; namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of christianity in the church of  rome, then a true church, were liberally endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying:  now is poison poured  down into the church, etc.  thus not only as oft as we speak, as one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or  consequence, we subject ourselves to everyone’s censure, and happy is he that is least tossed upon tongues; for utterly to  escape the snatch of them it is impossible.  if any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the meaner sort only, and  that princes are privileged by their high estate, he is deceived.  ``as the sword devoureth as well one as the other,`` as it is in  samuel [2 sam 11:25], nay as the great commander charged his soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy,  but at the face; and as the king of syria commanded his chief captains to ``fight neither with small nor great, save only  against the king of israel:`` [1 kings 22:31] so it is too true, that envy striketh most spitefully at the fairest, and at the  chiefest.  david was a worthy prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deeds, and yet for as worthy as act as preface to 1611 translation iv  ever he did (even for bringing back the ark of god in solemnity) he was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife [2 sam  6:16].  solomon was greater than david, though not in virtue, yet in power: and by his power and wisdom he built a temple  to the lord, such a one as was the glory of the land of israel, and the wonder of the whole world.  but was that his  magnificence liked of by all?  we doubt it.  otherwise, why do they lay it in his son’s dish, and call unto him for easing the  burden, ``make``, say they, ``the grievous servitude of thy father, and his sore yoke, lighter?`` [1 kings 12:4]  belike he had  charged them with some levies, and troubled them with some carriages; hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their  heart the temple had never been built.  so hard a thing it is to please all, even when we please god best, and do seek to  approve ourselves to every ones conscience.  if we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance.  the first  roman emperor [c. caesar. plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the learned, nor more profitable to posterity, for  conserving the record of times in true supputation; than when he corrected the calendar, and ordered the year according to  the course of the sun; and yet this was imputed to him for novelty, and arrogance, and procured to him great obloguy.  so  the first christened emperor [constantine] (at the least-wise that openly professed the faith himself, and allowed others to do  the like) for strengthening the empire at his great charges, and providing for the church, as he did, got for his labour the  name pupillus, as who would say, a wasteful prince, that had need of a guardian or overseer [aurel. victor].  so the best  christened emperor [theodosius], for the love that he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich both himself and his subjects, and  because he did not see war but find it, was judged to be no man at arms [zosimus], (though indeed he excelled in feats of  chivalry, and showed so much when he was provoked) and condemned for giving himself to his ease, and to his pleasure. to  be short, the most learned emperor of former times [justinian], (at the least, the greatest politician) what thanks had he for  cutting off the superfluities of the laws, and digesting them into some order and method?  this, that he had been blotted by  some to be an epitomist, that is, one that extinguishes worthy whole volumes, to bring his abridgments into request.  this is  the measure that hath been rendered to excellent princes in former times, even, cum bene facerent, male audire, for their  good deeds to be evil spoken of.  neither is there any likelihood, that envy and malignity died, and were buried with the  ancient.  no, no, the reproof of moses taketh hold of most ages; ``you are risen up in your fathers’ stead, and increase of  sinful men.`` [num 32:14]  ``what is that that hath been done? that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the  sun,`` saith the wiseman: [ecc 1:9] and s. stephen, ``as your fathers did, so do you.`` [acts 7:51]  his majesty’s constancy, notwithstanding culmination, for the survey of the english  translations  this, and more to this purpose, his majesty that now reigneth (and long, and long may he reign, and his offspring forever,  ``himself and children, and children’s always) knew full well, according to the singular wisdom given unto him by god, and  the rare learning and experience that he hath attained unto; namely that whosoever attempteth anything for the public  (especially if it pertain to religion, and to the opening and clearing of the word of god) the same setteth himself upon a  stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue.  for he that medleth with men’s religion in any part, medleth with their custom, nay, with their freehold; and though they  find no content in that which they have, yet they cannot abide to hear of altering.  notwithstanding his royal heart was not  daunted or discouraged for this that colour, but stood resolute, ``as a statue immovable, and an anvil not easy to be beaten  into plates,`` as one [suidas] saith; he knew who had chosen him to be a soldier, or rather a captain, and being assured that  the course which he intended made for the glory of god, and the building up of his church, he would not suffer it to be  broken off for whatsoever speeches or practices.   it ",none

"`  ==proposal of changing name and structure of this page ==  i propose to change this page and show in it only reference links to various comparison charts, because it fails to show (as stated in the title):  [quote] the table only includes systems that are widely used and currently available. due to the large number and variety of available linux distributions, all of these operating systems are grouped under a single entry in these tables. [end quote]  it could have been called ``comparison table of oses recent than 5 years``, but it still presents macos and not only mac os x, that is the current selling version. (for example windows'95 and windows'98 are both canceled from the table, and only windows me is shown. and it is correct. because both 9x versions are discontinued from market longer than 5 years.)  os/2 is discontinued, and ibm plans to release it open source, but it is still on the table.  linux oses are shown apart. their invoice is no longer (?) necessary.  it lacks of oses still on the market, such as amigaos, which recently started also 2 split versions, aros and morphos (and also morphos it is currently on the market). [i wrote amigaos invoice in the table and i planned to insert morphos later].  it lacks of very interesting oses currently on the market such as rtos (real time operating systems), which major representative is qnx.  also it could have been called ``comparison table of operating systems with a million or larger userbase``, but then, freebsd and solaris are far from reaching this record of installed releases.   so i propose to create multiple pages of comparison charts, and this page pointing with respective links to each of them (historical chart ones, oses actually on the market, linux only, etcetera).  but one chart amongst the others must be a very extensive comparison table showing all existing oses, present and past ones, to be of reference for all readers, and mainly students and scholars.  criticisms and advices are welcome.  insert your sign and say why, if you agree or refuse to change this page.      [whoops. sorry. i am raffaele_megabyte, and i failed to log, becase i reconnected internet after a brief pause]  : in my opinion the tables should list oses that are widely used. however, use isn't the same as number of installed systems; that number just boosts desktop operating systems out of proportion. if, for example, a solaris system runs an application server used by 100 users, that would really have to count as 100 users, not just one. a good measure might be how often an os or services running on an os are directly or indirectly used by how many users. or to put it another way, the amount of ``real work`` done using that os. (of course this cannot really be measured, only estimated). : basically i'm all for including oses like qnx and similar systems, as right now the embedded operating systems are very under-represented. however, if we were to go down that road all the way, then we'd have to start including e.g. symbian os or windows ce, too, and there isn't really much point in comparing e.g. symbian os to solaris. : so if there was to be a split at all, i'd split it by target system type, i.e. server oses, workstation/desktop oses, embedded/realtime oses. with that kind of split, many systems could be clearly assigned to one of the types, instead of having to maintain the same data multiple times. also, splitting into multiple tables doesn't necessarily mean splitting into multiple articles. for example, it would be possible to simply have one section per target system type. : in either case, i'm very much against doing this kind of change in the ``reorganize first, fix later`` style, since a lot of changes tend to stop after the ``reorganize`` phase and never get around to actually filling in all the new content (e.g. i've seen a fair amount of people who insist that os xyz has to be in the tables, but then can't actually be bothered to add more than a sketchy version of the ``general information`` data.) : instead, i suggest you create the reorganized version as a page in your user namespace, and then post a link here for discussion.   `",none
"`  ==reversion undone== no good reasons were given for removing my changes, and both they and i have been falsely described. i am not an academic. nor do i believe that ``only people with european nonmedical academic doctorates deserve to be called doctor``.  the only kind of doctorate is an academic one. doctorates may be in medicine or any other subject. this is clear from the article, which the reverter appears not to have read properly.  as for 'european', there is absolutely no eurocentrism in the article. the us (a country with about 5% of the world's population) is exceptional in that bachelor's-level degrees in medicine are on paper called 'doctorates'. i left mention of this exception in the article. i believe, however, that it requires some explanation for those who might not be familiar with its exceptionality.  so that's three lazy errors already in the reverter's blurb: calling me an academic; saying that i think those who don't hold european doctorates shouldn't be called doctors; saying that i think those who hold medical doctorates shouldn't be called doctorates.  fourth, i left a lot of it as it was.  as for 'perspectives', i have no 'perspective' to offer. i was trying to keep to the facts. it is true that there is a history to this article, but this includes for example the mention by one discussant that 'doctor' is used as a noun to denote those with phds as well as to denote those who hold bachelor's-level degrees in medicine. that fact was not mentioned in the article itself before my changes.  (it might also be mentioned that the use of 'phd' to describe a person, as in 'john is a phd' is not encountered in the uk - at least, not in my experience. you would say 'john has got a phd).  my version can doubtless be improved, but this will best be done by those who have read it and considered the merits of the particular changes.  people read encyclopedias to learn new facts. whilst i am not saying that this one should be prescriptive, this does not mean that ignorant beliefs should not be countered. for example, i have met people in the uk who think that medics are 'doctors of medicine' and that people with doctorates are 'doctors' of some other subject, as if the qualifications were on the same level. that they aren't, is a fact, not an opinion.

"`: everyone falls short in discussions compared to tiger, who does have ten majors to singh's three. plus, singh has also only really distinguished himself as being the second best golfer in the world behind tiger since 2003. i think his age works against him a bit too, he was a late bloomer, and he is 42 now and it's not clear how much longer he's going to be at the top of his game. popularity is a complex factor and there are always going to be a lot of reasons, not just one reason like he's from a different country. it's certainly possible that singh gets a bit less attention than he might otherwise because he's not american, but recall when david duval hit #1 in the world, it's not like he got a huge amount of attention for that. as for the ``tiger wasn't doing his best`` line, that gets brought up with a lot of other golfers than just vijay singh. re. the google test, some other golf stars: mickelson (744,000 hits), els (349,000), goosen (251,000), nicklaus (760,000), palmer (880,000), garcia (326,000), duval (120,000), faldo (137,000).    `",none

(i'm sure you knew that).  second, like i told casito, this is a wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of ``defacement,`` which pertains more to secure/static websites (think us govt homepages for instance).  i don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will.  of course he didn't realise that i could see through his bluff, and when i calmly explained these two above points to him, he got really defensive and quite ``pissy,`` just as i'm sure he would in real life.  just between you and me, he just doesn't seem like a really ``cool kid.``  for you, however, i have the utmost respect, being a liberal arts professor in the only civilised part of the u.s. as far as i'm concerned.  however, you might want to hurry up presenting your evidence, since i'm once again leaving the country at 8:55 am tommorrow and won't be back until next month; and as i said on my user page, i won't be editing on wikipedia any more after i get back to work and my routine, etc.  but take care, don't take any crap from those snotty preppy know-it-all kids you have up there (and how would i know about that hmmmmm????) )!! `",none

"`   ==research== in the summary of a, so called ``edit``, by an anonymous user of whom we all know it's , done on the 24th of august 2005 (couple of times) it's written:   (this version is the most reliable version according to any facts, and according to any source!!!   all herein is researched. mario roering is a twisted insane person and so are his edits!)  besides the fact that he keeps calling me all kinds of names to which i can only comment look in the mirror!, he is talking about some ``research``. let me tell you here that this alleged research is the research performed by one single man (you guessed: peter lee!). i do not know if he really researched it all and is deliberately twisting the truth, but i have done a counter-research, together with a colleague, and came to a whole bunch of different conclusions!!! so far for this by peter lee so called ``research`` then... now, researched or not, this article here is about wgkf, the world genseiryu karatedo federation. everything written here is their point of view. it is not necessary to start every single sentence with ``according to wgkf...``, since it is already the title of the article, so it must be clear to anybody that this is about them, from them and according to them! deleting the facts (researched or not) and replacing them with the 'facts' from one single person who claims to have done research, but only brings in his point of view, makes the whole article about something that is not wgkf, but maybe about peter lee, or, just maybe, about gkif... and of course that is absolutely wrong! that is not what the article is about... nobody sees people from wgkf changing the story on gkif, do you??   14:36:29, 2005-08-24 (utc)`",none
